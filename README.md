##Meeting Capture for Surface Duo 2

Meeting Capture is one of the oldest templates that Microsoft offers that integrates Outlook, OneNote and Planner. The original version of the app it's not functional for Surface Duo 2. That is why we rebuilt it.

- Welcome Screen
- Home Screen
- Confirm Screen
- Export Screen
- Follow Up Screen
- Follow Up Times Screen
- Home Pop Ups Screen
- Collections and Varialbe Screen
